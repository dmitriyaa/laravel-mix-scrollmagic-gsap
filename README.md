# Description
In order to make ScrollMagic work with GSAP (TweenLite / TweenMax, TimelineLite / TimelineMax),
it is nesessary to include animation.gsap.js plugin ([official docs](http://scrollmagic.io/docs/animation.GSAP.html)).
However sometimes it gets a bit tricky with webpack.

In order to save you time, to configure webpack I've created this extension.

# Setting Up:
* ```npm install laravel-mix-scrollmagic-gsap```
